/**
 * Facilitates transfering large buffers of data between the client and
 * the server using the built in RPC framework and thus not requiring a
 * separate socket connection to be established. This allows users to reliably send
 * data larger than the usual limit by splitting the transfer up into chunks
 * and adding the chunks to the reliable buffer across multiple ticks as needed.
 * 
 * The main interface is SendBufferToServer/SendBufferToClient. After the transfer
 * completes, the caller's callback function is called on the sending side. This makes
 * it easy to have continuation logic inline with the transfer for what to do with the
 * buffer once it gets there. The buffer can be retrieved on the receiving side with
 * ClientGetsCompletedTransfer(...)/ServerGetsCompletedTransfer(...) depending on which
 * side was the receiver. The buffers can be freed when no longer needed using 
 * ClientFreesCompletedTransfer(...)/ServerFreesCompletedTransfer. The receiver MUST call
 * the corresponding FreesCompletedTransfer method or they will not get cleaned up until
 * the actor this component is attached to is destroyed.
 * 
 * The public interface to this class's methods all have a Client and Server
 * version to be very explicit which side of the connection has the buffer and which side
 * is sending it and each point. Internally they do the same thing plus error checking.
